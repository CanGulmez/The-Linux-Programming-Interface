# The Linux Programming Interface

I think that the most compheresive and wonderful book related linux 
programming is `The Linux Programming Interface by Michael KERRISK`. 
I've read and practiced this book frequently. So on, I decided to 
share my notes and source codes via GitHub. I've seperated this 
project into different topics. These are `File IOs and Directories`, 
`Memory Allocation`, `Time and Timers`, `System andProcesses`, `Signals`,
`Interprocess Communication (IPS)`, `Threads`, and lastly `Sockets`.
